# Hospital-Readmission-Prediction (Version - 1)

* This project is a classification project where I need to predict Hospital Readmission using various factors divided into categorical columns such as age, medical_speciality, diag_1, diag_2, diag_3, glucose_test, A1Ctest, change, diabetes_med and numerical columns such as time_in_hospital, n_lab_procedures, n_procedures, n_medications, n_outpatients, n_inpatients, and n_emergency. 
* Overall the dataset has 25000 rows and 17 columns 
* I have done detailed Exploratory data Analysis of the data and make as many visualizations as possible to find the distinct features. 
* Converted categorical variables to numerical one using Label-Encoder
* Standardized the data using StandardScaler 
* As of now I used 3 models(Logistic Regression, DecisionTree Classifier, RandomForest Classifier) and used accuracy as a metrics
